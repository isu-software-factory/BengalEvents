### Ruby Version
- The ruby version installed currently is 2.5.5.

### Guide for Installation and initial configuration

- Download rails packages software at "http://railsinstaller.org/en" based on your operating system.

    - Follow link, then click on the button labeled Windows to start download.
    - Follow prompts from installation wizard and go through the setup files.
    
- Confirm download versions
    - Run commands in terminal `ruby -v`, `gem -v`, and `rails -v`. The application uses 2.5.5 for ruby, 5.2.3 for rails, 2.7.6.2 for gem. 
    - If the `ruby -v` does not match with the application go to this website to download the version.                 https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
    - In the ruby installer, the recommend version is Ruby+Devkit 2.5.5-1(x64) because it provides the biggest number of compatible gems       and installs MSYS2-Devkit alongside Ruby, so that gems with C-extensions can be compiled immediately.

    - If error "You Must use Bundler 2 or greater" run `gem install bundler`, then run `bundle install` again
